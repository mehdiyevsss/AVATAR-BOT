    "title": "Historical Overview",
    "content": "Swisscom’s origins trace back to 1851 with the establishment of a state-run telegraph service in Switzerland. Over the years, this service evolved to include telephone communications, leading to the formation of the PTT (Post, Telegraph, and Telephone) in 1920, which combined postal and telecommunication services. In 1997, the telecommunications division was separated from the postal services, resulting in the creation of Swisscom. The following year, Swisscom was partially privatized through a public offering on the Swiss stock exchange. A significant milestone in Swisscom’s expansion was the acquisition of a majority stake in the Italian telecommunications company Fastweb in 2007 for approximately 5 billion CHF. This move strengthened Swisscom’s position in the European telecommunications market.
